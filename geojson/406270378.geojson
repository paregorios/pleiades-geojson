  "description": "The Theater of Nero located in the Vaticanus Ager is relatively little known and receives little attention in the ancient sources. Archaeological discoveries announced in the summer of 2023 seem to point to remains of the theater preserved beneath the courtyard of the Palazzo della Rovere located between the Borgo Santo Spirito and the Via della Conciliazione. The first-century CE theater seems to have been dismantled by the second-century CE.",
