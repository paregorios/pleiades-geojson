  "description": "Thymbra was a place in the Troad. It is most famous as the site of the sanctuary known as Thymbraeum, a site sacred to Apollo Thymbraeus. In the Trojan War cycle, this is the place where Achilles reportedly ambushed and killed the Trojan prince Troilus. The nature of the site and its location is debated in the ancient sources. It was said to be located along the Thymbrios River, a tributary of the Scamander. It is referred to as a polis only by Stephanus of Byzantium. Other authors, including Strabo, use the term tópos or pedíon to describe Thymbra. It may be that Thymbra should be associated with an archaeological site south of Akçaköy, at least according to Cook.",
