  "description": "Statues of the tyrannicides Harmodios and Aristogeiton, the assassins of the tyrant Hipparchos and symbols of the Athenian democracy. An initial pair, made by Antenor were erected in the Athenian Agora ca. 510 BC, taken away to Susa by the Persians in 480 BC and returned by Alexander or one of his successors in the late fourth century BC. A replacement pair, made by Kritios and Nesiotes were erected in the Athenian Agora in 477 BC. With few exceptions it was forbidden to erect other statues in the vicinity. Part of the base of the second pair has been found, but not in situ.",
