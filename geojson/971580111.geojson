  "description": "The so-called \"Flaminio Obelisk\" at Rome was created in Egypt during the Nineteenth Dynasty under Pharaoh Seti I. The obelisk was erected at Heliopolis under Ramesses II. In 1 BCE, the obelisk was transported to Rome on the orders of Augustus. It was transported with the Obelisk of Montecitorio. The Flaminio Obelisk was re-erected on the spina of the Circus Maximus. It was discovered in a fragmentary state in 1587 along with the so-called Lateran Obelisk. Following the orders of Pope Sixtus V, Domenico Fontana restored the obelisk and erected it as the centerpiece of the Piazza del Popolo in 1589. It is supported by a travertine podium that was constituted from fragments of the Severan Septizodium on the flank of the Palatine Hill, a monument that had been demolished on papal orders.",
