  "description": "The sanctuary sacred to Demeter is located on the Gypsadhes hill, just south of the Minoan 'palace' complex. On this hill, D.G. Hogarth excavated a series of Minoan houses beginning in 1900. Within this area, a first-millennium BCE sanctuary would develop. Excavation reports note the comingling of Minoan remains and Hellenistic deposits. The Classical sanctuary was suspected in 1927 on the basis of sporadic finds, but significant excavations did not begin until 1957.",
