  "description": "Remnants of an ancient settlement have been identified south and east of the modern beach village of Nopigeia on Crete that date to at least the 5th century BCE. The church of Agios Georgios Nopigion, which is located between Nopigia and Drapania, was built on the remains of a Roman-era bath complex. A single, late source (Aelian) provides the name Mithymna, which may have belonged to this settlement. Bronze Age remains have also been identified in the vicinity.",
