  "description": "Field surveys, geophysical prospection, as well as targeted research and training excavations, have revealed the remains of a mid- to late- imperial rural settlement with evidence for agricultural activity. However, the earliest finds (e.g., bucchero) date to the sixth/fifth century B.C., indicating the likelihood of Etruscan settlement activities at this site. The entire site seems to have undergone severe recycling and reuse processes in late antiquity and the remaining structures have broken down systematically in modern times. Ongoing intensive agricultural activities affect the few archaeological structures that remain, resulting in a poor state of preservation.",
