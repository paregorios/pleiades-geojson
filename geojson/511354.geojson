  "description": "Founded as a Greek city in the Propontis region of Anatolia, perhaps ca. 709 BCE, Persians would come to control Parium in 546 BCE. The city allied itself with Athens during the Peloponnesian War, but was subsequently ruled again by the Persians again. Its long occupation included a Macedonian phase, followed by control exercise by the Seleucids, the Kingdom of Pergamon, the Romans, and the Byzantines.",
