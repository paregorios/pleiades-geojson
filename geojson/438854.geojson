  "description": "Touxion was a Samnite metropolis that is referred to in several obscure texts. It is linked to the career of Fabius Fabricianus, a kinsman of Fabius Maximus, who is said to have sacked the city and carried off to Rome as plunder the statue of Aphrodite Nikephoros (a.k.a. Venus Victrix). The location of Touxion is uncertain. Torelli speculates that it may have been conquered in the campaigns of 292-1 B.C. along with Cominium and Venusium. Smith notes the Oresteia-like parallels in this narrative.",
