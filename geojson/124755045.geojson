  "description": "Extensive gardens in the Transtiberim that were initially owned by Agrippina Maior, the Horti Agrippinae are perhaps best known for their association with the reigns of the emperors Caius and Nero, respectively. These gardens likely covered much of the Ager Vaticanus, including the present-day site of St. Peter's Basilica. Both the circus Gai et Neroni and the theatrum Neronis were included in their extent. A terraced portico was to be found along the riverfront, elements of which were documented archaeologically in 2024 in the area of Piazza Pia.",
