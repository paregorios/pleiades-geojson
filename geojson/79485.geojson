  "description": "A multi-period site with evidence of construction and occupation ranging from the Neolithic to the Medieval periods. An iron age farmstead was replaced by a series of Roman-era constructs, including a late first-century CE masonry establishment, often characterized as a Roman villa (the site is located near the site of Verulanium, modern St. Albans). Renovated in the late second century, the farm declined in the third.",
