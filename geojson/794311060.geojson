  "description": "In what seems to be a Neo-Assyrian layer inside a Parthian house in hC10IV, excavators found the remains of a library, consisting of about 20 fragmentary clay tablets. The largest group of texts are incantations, but the library also included a prayer, lexical lists and a list of persons, as well as a literary text detailing the netherworld vision of an Assyrian prince. One of the texts, a memorandum, dates to the reign of Sin-šarru-iškun (ca. 626–612 BC).",
