  "description": "The \"Colossus Neronis\" or \"Colossal Statue of Nero\" was a monumental bronze statue of the first-century CE emperor reportedly created by Zenodorus. The statue was originally an element of the sprawling Domus Aurea of Nero but the monument endured long after Nero's reign. The statue's original position likely marked the summit of the Velian Hill. The Flavians refashioned the statue to resemble Sol and Hadrian relocated the statue nearer the Flavian amphitheater as part of the work to create the Temple of Venus and Roma.",
