  "description": "Elephas herbarius (Elefantum herbarium), a place included in the Notitia, is mentioned only once and must lie at the southern limit of Regio VIII. Coarelli concludes that this place must have been located on the lower slopes of the Capitoline Hill facing the Forum Holitorium. Its coincidence with Late Antique and Medieval toponyms suggests that it refers to an ancient statue of an elephant, perhaps one shown eating plants, in the area of the Forum Holitorium.",
