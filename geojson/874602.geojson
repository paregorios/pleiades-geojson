  "description": "An important region surrounding the Tigrisâ€“Euphrates river system, in the northern part of the Fertile Crescent, roughly corresponding to most of modern Iraq and Kuwait, eastern Syria, and Southeastern Turkey. Mesopotamia was a critical part of many empires and kingdoms, including the Sumerians, Akkadians, Assyrians, Babylonians, the Achaemenids, Alexander the Great, and the Seleucids. It was also a site of intense conflict between the Roman, Parthian, and Sassanid Empires until the 7th century Muslim conquest.",
