  "description": "A clay pot with about thirty clay tablets was found to the north of the Šamaš Gate at Nineveh, in a secondary context. The archive, whose texts are dated between 669 BC and the fall of Nineveh (612 BC), belonged to Ninurta-šarru-uṣur (“the son of the palace”), as well as to several other people, including some Egyptians. This small archive consists of loan and purchase documents, legal texts, as well as a piece of correspondence.",
