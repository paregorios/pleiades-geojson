  "description": "In House 20, connected to \"Westgasse\" by a small alley-way, excavators found apotropaic clay figurines and plaques under the floor. Near a terracotta sarcophagus in cE6III, an archive of 14 clay tablets was found as well, either having been deposited there or having secondarily fallen down into it. Another clay tablet was found in cE6IV, with an additional tablet with similarities possibly also belonging to this group. The available datings are from the second half of the 7th century BC. The archive, belonging to Mutaqqin-Aššur, a doorkeeper, as well as others with the same title, consists mainly of loan documents, and also contains a purchase document and a juridical settlement.",
