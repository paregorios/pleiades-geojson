  "description": "A two-aisled Doric stoa ran along the south side of the Panathenaic Way from the Stoa Basileios towards the Dipylon Gate, which contained shops. It was constructed over a long period beginning in the early second century BC and repeatedly modified. The building was destroyed in the Herulian Sack of 267 AD, rebuilt, damaged in the Gothic Sack of 396 AD, rebuilt again, and was finally destroyed in the Slavic Sack of 582 AD.",
