  "description": "A complex of three stone-built structures in the ancient settlement of Sikait in Egypt's Eastern Desert. The structure seems to have served a primarily residential function, certainly during the 4th and 5th centuries CE and (in a previous phase) during an as-yet undetermined earlier period. It may also have had a commercial function.",
