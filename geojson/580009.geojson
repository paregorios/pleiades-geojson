  "description": "Lamptrai Paraloi (\"coastal Lamptrai\") or Lamptrai Hypenerthen (\"Lower Lamptrai\") was a coastal deme in the tribe of Erechtheis in Attica. The epithets distinguished it from neighbouring Lamptrai Kathyperthen (\"Upper Lamptrai\"), which was also in Erechtheis. For some purposes the two demes seem to have operated as a single entity.",
