  "description": "A set of poros benches built on the east slope of the Kolonos Agoraios at the edge of the Athenian Agora in the fifth century BC, which seated 400-500 people and perhaps served as a meeting place for a council or court. They were truncated and rendered inaccessible by further construction in the fourth century BC.",
