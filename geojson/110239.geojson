  "description": "Romans built a bridge over the Rhine river at Mogontiacum soon after 27 CE, based on dendrochronological evidence. This bridge likely replaced an earlier pontoon bridge. The first-century CE bridge spanned some 400 meters and was supported by 21 piers. The bridge facilitated an important road link and was repaired multiple times in antiquity. It may be the bridge pictured on a medallion issued by Constantius I Chlorus. The modern Theodor Heuss Bridge (Mainz-Wiesbaden) that was rebuilt following the Second World War stands at or near the point in the river once spanned by the Roman bridge.",
