  "description": "In the northern corner, along the northwest town wall of Assur (bD5I, bC/D5II, bC5III), researchers unearthed Houses 67–68 with an archive belonging to a family with the title ḫunduraya, a gentilic meaning \"from Ḫundur\". Another archive belonging to a related family of ḫunduraya was found nearby (Assur Archive 24). In House 67 and 68, about 48 clay tablets and fragments were found. The tablets mostly date to the second half of the 7th century BC. The archive consists of loans, mostly concerning silver, work contracts, purchase documents and a juridical settlement.",
