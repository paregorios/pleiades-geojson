  "description": "Most documents found in the Northwest Palace, built by the Assyrian king Ashurnarsipal II (883–859 BC), predate the move of the new Assyrian capital to Dur-Šarrukin under Sargon II (721–705 BC). Inside the well of Room AB, British excavators found the leaves of approximately thirty ivory and wooden writing boards, thus constituting the largest and best-preserved discovery of writing boards in Mesopotamia. According to the Akkadian text preserved on one of the objects, some of the writing boards contain copies of the astrological series Enūma Anu Enlil belonging to “the palace of Sargon (II).”",
