  "description": "Pašime is an ancient settlement located at Tall Abū Šījah, an archaeological site in the Maysan province of southeastern Iraq, close to the Iranian border. The site was inhabited perhaps already from the fourth millennium BCE, and particularly in the third and early second millennium BCE. The name Pašime appears in an Old Akkadian inscription discovered at the site in the course of excavations by the Iraq State Board of Antiquities and Heritage in 2007. The inscription was dedicated to the god Šuda, indicating that a temple devoted to this deity may have been located at Pašime.",
