  "description": "An ancient settlement in Macedonian Pieria on a hilltop named Koryphi, near modern Nea Agathoupolis in the Pydna-Kalindros municipality in Pieria, Greece. The site was occupied from the Late Neolithic period (ca. 4000 BCE) through 354 BCE, when it was destroyed by the armies of Philip II. It was succeeded by a new settlement approximately 1km to the northwest; known as Macedonian Methone, this later settlement was occupied in the Hellenistic and Roman periods.",
