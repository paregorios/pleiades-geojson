  "description": "A hilltop archaeological site in southeastern Albania, presently named after the adjacent modern village, that lies less than 2km northeast of modern Korça. Its precise nature is not yet known, but earlier suggestions that it was a burial mound have been refuted by the discovery of significant stone walls and small finds datable to the Iron Age and possibly the Hellenistic period.",
