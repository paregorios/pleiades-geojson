  "description": "An ancient site and likely anchorage on the coast of the Syrtic Gulf, east of ancient Macomades (modern Sirte). Charax/(I)Scina is well-attested in the Roman gazetteers and so there is general agreement that the as-yet-undiscovered site must be at or in the vicinity of the medieval fortified settlement of Surt (formerly Medina Sultan/Mdayna en Syrtique).",
