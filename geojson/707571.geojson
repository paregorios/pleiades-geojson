  "description": "Located at Malloura, Cyprus, are the remains of human settlement activity ranging from the Archaic period in the eastern Mediterranean to the time of the Roman Empire. The site has yielded evidence of a sanctuary with votive activity as well as funereal evidence. Modern exploration of the site began in 1990 under the direction of Michael K. Toumazou.",
