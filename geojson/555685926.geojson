  "description": "Gövelek is a village situated 27 km to the east of Van in the southeast of Turkey. Here the upper part of a stela with an inscription of Rusa, son of Erimena (presumably last quarter of 8th century BCE) was found. It reports his military success and describes deportations from the city Ṭušpa, the building of the city Rusaḫinili, and the creation of an artificial lake called \"Lake of Rusa\". The lake was supposed to ensure the water supply for the capital Ṭušpa (modern Van Kalesi), a function it still performs today. The lower part of the stela has been found at the shore of the lake.",
