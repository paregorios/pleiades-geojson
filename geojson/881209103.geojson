  "description": "From the first half of the second millennium BC until 614 BC, there was a ziggurat, a temple-tower, at Assur dedicated to the god Aššur (and his manifestation as the god Enlil). This sacred building, which went by the Sumerian name Earattakišarra (”House, Mountain/Noblest of the Universe”) in the first millennium BC and referred to as the “great ziggurat” in Middle Assyrian royal inscriptions, was likely founded by the Old Assyrian ruler Šamšī-Adad I (ca. 1808–1776 BC).",
