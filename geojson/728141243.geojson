Its name Delibaba (Velibaba) comes from the modern Turkish village Delibaba (Velibaba) which is situated in the vicinity of the fortress. A stone inscription of the Urartian king Minua, son of Išpuini (9th / 8th century BCE) which was found there reports that the fortress was built by Minua \"through the protection of the god Haldi\". The Urartian name of the fortress is unknown.",
