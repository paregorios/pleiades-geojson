  "description": "Chalkis was a settlement on Euboea, inhabited from the sub-Neolithic period, which played an important role in Greek colonisation of the Mediterranean in the 8th century BC. It was part of the Delian League in the 5th century BC and the Second Athenian Sea League in the 4th century BC. In Hellenistic times it was one of the three 'fetters of Greece' used by Macedon to control Greece. It came under Roman control in 197 BC.",
