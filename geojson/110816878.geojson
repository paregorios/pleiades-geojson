  "description": "Three tiers of niches were found in Room H 5 (on the northwestern side of Forecourt I) of the Nabû temple at Dur-Šarrukin, the short-lived capital of the Assyrian king Sargon II (721–705 BC). Fragments of clay tablets and inscribed prisms in these niches suggest that a temple library was located here. The empty niches might be a result of the move of the capital to Nineveh under Sennacherib (704–681 BC) or of the use of perishable writing materials.",
