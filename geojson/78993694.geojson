  "description": "The Hellenistic Arsenal is the modern name for a rectangular building on the Kolonos Agoraios in Athens, built in the 270s or 260s BC and destroyed during the Sullan Sack of Athens in 86 BC. It appears to have been modelled on the Naval Arsenal at Piraeus and was probably used for the storage of weapons and armour.",
