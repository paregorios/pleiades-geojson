  "description": "Tall Marjab is a small, heavily denuded mound in the Dhi Qar province of southern Iraq, some 15 kilometers south of Nasiriya and ca. 10 kilometres southeast of Ur. Traces of a small settlement dating to fourth and third millennium BCE were found here in the course of brief excavations by British archaeologists Leonard Woolley and Max Mallowan in 1929-30.",
