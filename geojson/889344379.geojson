  "description": "British excavators found fragments of at least eight or nine large clay tablets in the Throne Room of the Nabû Temple (Ezida). These now-fragmentarily-preserved tablets, all of which date to 672 BC, contain copies of treaties that seventh-century-BC Assyrian king Esarhaddon (r. 680–669 BC) made with several Median client rulers. These ‘covenant’ documents — which are often referred to as “Esarhaddon’s Succession Treaty” or “Esarhaddon’s Vassal Treaty” — were written up to ensure loyalty to Ashurbanipal, Esarhaddon’s fourth eldest son, when he ascended the Assyrian throne upon the death of his father.",
