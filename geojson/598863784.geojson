  "description": "The Palace of Sennacherib (South-Palace Palace) at Nineveh remained in use until the Assyrian capital was captured, looted, and destroyed in 612 BC. Numerous tablets discovered in Rooms XL and XLI, as well as in some of the adjoining rooms, nineteenth-century British excavators unearthed the remains of a library, including many clay tablets inscribed with literary texts. During the reign of Ashurbanipal (r. 668–ca. 631 BC), the last great king of Assyria, the tablets found in this archive repository were probably part of his tablet collection.",
