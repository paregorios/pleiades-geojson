  "description": "The low hill known as Monte Giulio is anthropic, formed by the accumulation of sediment atop an ancient quay. Archaeological investigation beginning in 1968 revealed numerous architectural remains, including a cistern and a bath complex along the via Guidoni. The ruins of the so-called Capitaneria, or Harbor office, are located near the modern stele to the Fallen of Kindu. This complex seems to have been connected to the management of port traffic and was in use from the reign of Claudius until the fourth century.",
