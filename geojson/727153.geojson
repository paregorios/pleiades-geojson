  "description": "Immediately north of modern Hawwariya on the southern shore of Lake Mariout in Egypt, archaeological excavations have uncovered an extensive and evidently purpose-built settlement of the latter sixth century CE, with remains of harbor and industrial installations, baths, shops, a funerary church, and a large basilica. This site, probably to be identified as Philoxenite, catered to the needs of pilgrims travling to shrine of Saint Menas in Abu Mina. It expanded and replaced a site of at least Hellenistic and Roman date that is perhaps to be identified as Mareia.",
