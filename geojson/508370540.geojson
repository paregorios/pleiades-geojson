  "description": "The archaeological site of Stancija Blek (Tar-Vabrega, Istria-Croatia) is located on the west coast of Istria. In antiquity, the site would have been located in the territory of Parentium. Archaeological investigation has documented more than 1,500 years of occupation, beginning perhaps with a Roman-period agricultural establishment (villa) that was subsequently followed by Late Antique and Medieval phases that include a so-called tower. Nearby are the remains of the church of Santa Croce.",
