  "description": "The Old Palace was the most important palace complex in the city of Assur. Although the oldest, securely-datable archaeological existence for the palace dates to the early Middle Assyrian period, this royal residence was probably founded in the Old Assyrian period, possibly during the reign of Šamšī-Adad I (ca. 1836–1776 BC). This important building was continuously until the sack and destruction of Assur in 614 BC. The Old Palace not only served as a residence for the Assyrian king and his family and an administrative center, but it was also a place of worship where the gods gathered on special occasions and the burial place of Assyrian kings.",
