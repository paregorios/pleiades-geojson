  "description": "Kisurra (modern Tell Abu Hatab) was established in the Early Dynastic II period (ca. 2700 BCE). The importance of this settlement, which was located only a few kilometers north of Šuruppak (modern Fārā) and which was situated on the western bank of the Euphrates River, declined significantly during the Old Babylonian Period. Numerous cuneiform tablets have been unearthed at Tell Abu Hatab since 1902.",
