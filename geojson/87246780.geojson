  "description": "In a fill from various rooms of a private house (in area eA8V), excavators discovered an archive of 75 texts, belonging to Duri-Aššur and his business partners. The archive consists of letters, purchase and loan documents, divisions of inheritance, and other legal documents, as well as administrative lists. Most of these texts are concerned with trade. The available datings suggest that Duri-Aššur and his business partners were active in the trade north of Assur from 651 to the destruction of the city in 614 BC. Notably, some documents exemplify the financial independency of Egyptian women in Assur.",
