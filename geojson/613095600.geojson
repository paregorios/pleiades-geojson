  "description": "Monte Savello is an area located in Rome's Sant'Angelo district, between the pons Fabricius and the Capitoline Hill. Its status as 'monte' is owed to the fact that an artificial mound of debris accumulated in the area of the Circus Flaminius and the Theater of Marcellus, a mound that came to serve as a de facto quarry for spoliated building materials. \"Savello\" refers to the post-eleventh century incorporation of the area within the fortifications of the Savello family. Modern excavations have revealed Roman, post-Roman, Medieval, and more recent settlement horizons.",
