  "description": "In Huzirina, about 400 clay tablets were discovered in a secondary position outside a private house with a central courtyard in area F. Likely, this library was previously located in the private house since a similar type of clay tablet was also found in the central courtyard. The library dates from 718 BC to the end of the Assyrian Empire and belonged to a family of šangû-priests: Qurdi-Nergal, his son Mušallim-Baba and others. The library consists of incantations, incantation rituals, medical texts, prayers, hymns and lexical lists, including god-lists.",
