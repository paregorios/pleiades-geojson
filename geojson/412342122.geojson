  "description": "A city in western Syria first settled in the Early Bronze Age III (ca. 2700-2600 BCE). In the Middle Bronze Age (2000-1600 BCE), it became a major trading center and the capital of a regional kingdom. In the Late Bronze Age Qatna the city became a vassal of first the Mitanni Kingdom, then the Neo-Hittite Empire and Egypt. The city's acropolis was abandoned in the Late Bronze Age I, though the surrounding area remained inhabited. It was resettled in the 10th century BCE as part of the Aramaean kingdom of Hamath, but was sacked by the army of Sargon II in 720 and ultimately abandoned in the 6th century BCE.",
