  "description": "In Room NT16, on the southern side of the inner courtyard of the Nabû Temple (Ezida) at Kalhu, British excavators found twenty-one cuneiform clay dockets; these date from 699 to 652 BC. The texts in this archival repository are principal corn loan documents. Some might have been attached to Aramaic texts that were written on perishable materials, such as papyrus.",
