  "description": "The Middle Stoa, the largest structure in the Agora of Athens, was built after 183 BC, as the north side of the South Square. In the Augustan Period, the Odeon of Agrippa was built on its north side. It was destroyed during the Herulian Sack of 267 AD and used as building material for the Post-Herulian Wall.",
