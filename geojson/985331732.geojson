  "description": "Three seventh-century-B.C. archives were excavated in Fort Shalmaneser, a building complex in the southeastern corner of the city Kalhu. In the northern corner of the south courtyard, mostly in Rooms SE 1 and SE 10, British excavators discovered the archive of the rab ēkalli (“palace manager”). The archive consists of twenty-seven tablets, most of which are sealed. These documents are concerned with the rab ēkalli’s work as manager. The sealed clay bulla were attached to wooden objects such as boxes or writing boards and secured with a string.",
