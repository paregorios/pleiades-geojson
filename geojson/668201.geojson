  "description": "A first- through tenth-century CE settlement located on the right bank of the Euphrates River in Syria's Aleppo Governorate, the site of Dibsi Faraj was excavated in the 1970s ahead of the Tabqa Dam project which eventually inundated the area. The excavations were jointly organized by Dumbarton Oaks and the University of Michigan under Richard Harper, following initial work by the Syrian culture ministry. The site was shown to be a heavily fortified one with Roman and Byzantine phases. It came to be abandoned after ca. 859 CE.",
