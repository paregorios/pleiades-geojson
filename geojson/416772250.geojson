  "description": "As part of his post-689-BC religious reforms, the Neo-Assyrian king Sennacherib (704–681 BC) had a new New Year’s festival house (akītu-house) constructed outside the western wall of Assur. This was an attempt to replicate the cultic topography of Babylon. The Sumerian ceremonial names of that holy building and its cella are Eabbaugga (\"House Where Tiāmat Is Put To Death\") and Edubdubabba (\"House That Makes Tiāmat Tremble”) respectively.",
