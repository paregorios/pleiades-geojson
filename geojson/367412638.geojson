  "description": "Omega House is the modern name for a large house on the north slope of the Areopagos hill in Athens. Early traces go back to the 4th century BC, but the surviving structure was built in the 4th and 5th centuries AD. It appears to have been a philosophical school until the 6th century. It was destroyed in the Slavic Sack of 582 AD.",
