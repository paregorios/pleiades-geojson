  "description": "Stonea, also referred to as Stonea Iron Age Camp, is located near March in the Cambridgeshire Fens in eastern England. Occupation of the hill fort begins ca. 500 BCE. Roman activity could be related to a military engagement in 47 CE mentioned by Tacitus. This engagement was between the Iceni tribe and Roman auxiliaries commanded by Ostorius Scapula.",
