  "description": "Among private houses in the north-east of the citadel, in Room 19 of House III, British excavators found forty-seven clay tablets, including two dockets, which might have been once attached to Aramaic texts written on perishable material (e.g., papyrus). This private archive belonged to the eunuch Šamaš-šarru-uṣur and a few other influential men. While most of the texts are loans of silver, corn, or birds, eleven of the texts are sale documents. There is also a list of silver and birds connected to different citizens of Kalhu.",
