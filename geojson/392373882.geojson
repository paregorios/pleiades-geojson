  "description": "Sippar-Amnanum (modern Tell ed-Der; also referred to as Sippar-Annunītu) was a small city located 6 km northeast of Sippar and 63 km north of Babylon. The goddess Annunītu was the patron deity of this sister city of Sippar and Eulmaš was its principal temple. An archive of ca. 2,000 cuneiform tablets dating the the reigns of several kings of the First Dynasty of Babylon were excavated in the house of Ur-Utu, the chief lamentation-priest of the goddess Annunītu. From several inscriptions of Nabonidus (r. 555–539 BC), Babylon’s last native king, it is certain that Sippar-Amnanum (which he refers to as Sippar-Annunītu) was still occupied and its cult was still in use in the sixth century BC, although it had been (partially) destroyed by the seventh-century-BC Assyrian king Sennacherib (r. 704–681 BC).",
