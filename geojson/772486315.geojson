  "description": "In House 12, in the western corner of a room with graves (in dD6IV), excavators found an archive of at least 17 clay tablets, two of which were Aramaic dockets. Other clay objects, mostly of which are probably spindle whorls, were found there as well. The house is situated next to another house containing an archive (Assur Archive 32). The dates on of the texts range from 659 BC to the years shortly before the fall of the city of Assur. The best attested central person is an individual called Nagahi, an Aramaic name. The archive consists of at least 6 loan documents, two receipts of payments, three purchase documents, a juridical settlement and other texts.",
