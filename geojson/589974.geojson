  "description": "Panormos was an ancient settlement and port of northern Crete, mentioned by Pliny. The Roman-era site was probably near and/or now covered by the destroyed remains of the 13th century Castel Milopotamo (Kastelli Mylopotamou) in modern Panormos. Aulopotamos, attested in late antiquity and thereafter as a bishop's seat, may refer to the same settlement and its region (the modern Mylopotamos river runs just south, emptying into the sea west of Panormos and finds of 7th and 8th century date have been excavated in the vicinity).",
