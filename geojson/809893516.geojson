  "description": "An apsidal structure on the Acropolis of Athens, built in the late 6th-century BC, destroyed in the Persian Sack of 480 BC, and perhaps repaired in the first half of the 5th century. It was probably located on the site of the northwest wing of the later Propylaia, which would have superseded it in 437 BC.",
