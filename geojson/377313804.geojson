  "description": "An archaeological site in the modern Parc National de l'Isalo in southern Madagascar. The site comprises rock-cut terraces, niches, walls, and other features in a style unique in the region. Radiocarbon dating of charcoal and stylistic dating of imported ceramics place activity at the site to a period spanning the 10th - 12th centuries CE. The excavators tentatively interpret the site as part of a former necropolis made by settlers with Zoroastrian origins.",
