  "description": "The so-called \"Meta Romuli\" was a pyramidal tomb located in the Ager Vaticanus at Rome. It likely dated to the first century BCE or the first century CE. Its extant superstructed was demolished in 1499. Remains of foundations and pavements that have been associated with the tomb were encountered in 1948-1949 during construction work in the first block of the north side of the present-day Via della Conciliazione.",
