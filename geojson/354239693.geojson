  "description": "A large architectural complex on the east side of the acropolis ridge in Cyrene that was probably built at the beginning of the first century AD and used as a gymnasium, but was later repurposed as forum in Flavian times, when the rooms north of the complex were levelled in order to build a large basilica. Various ruins can still be seen, including the podium of a temple in the central area, possibly dedicated to Dionysos. A fragmentary inscription referring to the \"portico of Caesar\", found over the inner side of the porch, made the place known as Caesareum.",
