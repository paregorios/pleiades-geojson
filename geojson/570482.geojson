  "description": "Methana/Arsinoe refers to a peninsula and settlement located on the north coast of the Argolid. In geological terms, the peninsula is formed by relatively recent volcanic activity, with the last-known eruptive activity in the third century BCE. Human activity on the peninsula spans many periods. The chief polity was located in the southwest of the peninsula where the modern village of Megalochori is found today.",
