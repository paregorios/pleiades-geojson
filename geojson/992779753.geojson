  "description": "An early medieval settlement in Spain (9th to 13th centuries CE) listed in contemporary Latin documents. This settlement is now identified with a second phase of occupation of an archaeological site known as El Forau de la Tuta near modern Arieda in Zaragosa province where a previously unknown Roman settlement has also been discovered. In addition to archaeological finds in situ, spolia from both the Roman and medieval phases have been identified in the more recent Ermita de San Pedro.",
