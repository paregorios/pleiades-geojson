  "description": "An ancient settlement mentioned only by Polybius who reports its destruction and despoiling by Philip of Macedon. Its acropolis is generally agreed to be identifiable with the fortified \"Palaiokastro\" that lies north of the modern Greek village of Mastron, just to the west of the church of Ag. Georgios. Other architectural finds were reported in the 20th century between the fortified site and the river Achelous to the west.",
