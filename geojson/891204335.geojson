  "description": "Three seventh-century-B.C. archives were excavated in Fort Shalmaneser, a building complex in the southeastern corner of the city Kalhu. In Room S 10, in the inner southern part of the palace, British excavators found the archive of the queen's household and of her šakintu (“woman manager”). The archive consists of eighteen clay tablets; most of the documents are sealed. The principal text categories found here are purchase documents, loans, and lawsuits.",
