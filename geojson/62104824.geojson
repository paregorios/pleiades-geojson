  "description": "In the southwest courtyard and nearby rooms of the Aššur temple, researchers found a library and an archive consisting of at least 301 clay tablets, mostly fragmentary, and possibly several hundred more. These tablets were concentrated in the northwest part of the courtyard, the northwest rooms and the Enpi gate, and some stone tablets and other inscribed objects were also found in this area. Tablets found in other parts of the Aššur temple complex also belong to Assur Archive 15. This includes at least 72 clay tablets, often fragmentary, as well as fragmentary clay prisms and cylinders. These tablets were mostly found in the southern part of the large forecourt, as well as west of the temple complex. The texts included in the library date from the Old Assyrian to the Neo Assyrian period, with a core of Middle Assyrian texts and contained cultic and hymnic texts, myths, omens, incantations, prescriptions, lexical lists, as well as hemerological, mathematical, astronomical and astrological texts. The dating of the archive is similar; it contained lists, decrees, letters and historical texts.",
