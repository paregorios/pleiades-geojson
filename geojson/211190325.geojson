  "description": "A church that many claim marks the birthplace of Jesus Christ is located in Bethlehem, now in the State of Palestine in the West Bank. The original church built on the site was commissioned by Constantine I and dedicated in May 339 CE. The church was destroyed by fire, likely in 529, and replaced by Justinian I.",
