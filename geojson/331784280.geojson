  "description": "In the Palace of Sennacherib (South-West Palace) at Nineveh, in Room LXI, nineteenth-century British excavators discovered about 450 clay bullae. Most of these had seal impressions on one side and indications on their backsides that they were fastened with rope to perishable materials (for example, papyrus and leather). These bullae are probably the remains of an archive of Aramaic documents.",
