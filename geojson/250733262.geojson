  "description": "Kaisaran (Kaissaran, Kayseran Ekece) is a modern mountain village in the mountains east of the Keşiş Gölü (\"Priest Lake\"), an artificial lake created by Rusa, son of Erimena (probably 8th century BCE). At an elevation of 2,780 m above the village (more than an hour’s difficult ascent) a rock inscription of probably the same ruler was found in the late 19th century. Another rock inscription and a stela of Rusa, son of Erimena have been found in other places in the vicinity of the lake. These are the rock inscriptions situated in Erek Dağ (CTU I A 14-3) and the so-called Keşiş Göl stela (CTU I A 14-1) whose upper part has been found at Gövelek.",
