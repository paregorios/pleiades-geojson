  "description": "A toponym (in the ablative: \"Monte\") attested in Peutinger Map routes between Sitifis and Cuicul (and possibly between Ad Olivam and Ruzai). It is perhaps to be identified with the ancient site of Mopht(i?), modern El-Kasr in Algeria's Beni Fouda municipality (SÃ©tif Province), but if so presents problems of interpretation as the Peutinger Map separately treats a \"Mopti Municipium\". See further the \"details\" section of this resource.",
