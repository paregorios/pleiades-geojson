  "description": "The Old Bouleuterion on the west side of the Agora in Athens was built in the early fifth century BC as the meeting place of the Boule or Council of 500. It also housed the Metroon, a shrine to the Mother of the Gods. The Council moved to the New Bouleuterion at the end of the fifth century BC, but the Old Bouleuterion remained in use as an archive and shrine. It was renovated ca. 140 BC and destroyed in the Herulian Sack of 267 AD. In the early 5th century AD, one of the rooms was rebuilt, possibly for use as a synagogue.",
