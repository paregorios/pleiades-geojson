  "description": "An archaeological site located 4.5km west southwest of modern Dolichi in Greece's Larisa regional unit (Thessaly). Here, a proto-byzantine walled settlement with three basilicas was built partly with spolia from a temple of Herakles and the ancient city of Doliche. On this basis, the excavators have argued for identification of the archaeology with the attested name; however, the lack so far of in-situ evidence predating the 6th century CE has led other scholars to continue to identify the original Classical-Roman polis of Doliche with the archaeological site at Sarandoporo.",
