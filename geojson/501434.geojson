  "description": "The Hellespont is a narrow strait of northwestern Turkey that connects the Aegean Sea to Propontis (Sea of Marmara). It is known today as the Dardanelles. Pseudo-Apollodorus records a myth that seems to have been widespread in antiquity: the Hellespont got its name by being the place where Helle, sister of Phrixus, fell off the flying golden ram.",
