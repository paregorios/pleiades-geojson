  "description": "The Mamu temple of Imgur-Enlil was located on the northeastern side of the citadel. In Room 8, behind the secondary cella, an archive of 40 clay tablets, belonging to Šumma-ilu and Mamu-iqbi, was discovered. While most texts date to the first half of the 7th century, three texts are older – dating from 734 to 710 BC. The archive consists of debt-notes, leases, one purchase agreement and other legal documents.",
