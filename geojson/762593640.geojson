  "description": "In the city of Tušhan, modern Ziyaret Tepe in Turkey, excavators discovered an Assyrian archive of 28 clay tablets, most of which were found in Rooms 9 and 10 of the administrative complex in the lower town. Weights, tokens, and sealings were found there as well, suggesting that the building served economic purposes. The majority of texts deal with administrative transactions of barley, as well as other commodities, such as copper, garments, and sheep. The archive seems to date to the final years of the empire. Indeed, one of the texts is a letter in which the writer describes the collapse of the administrative and military infrastructure around him.",
