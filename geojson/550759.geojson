  "description": "A region of northwestern Asia Minor that ancient sources associate with the Mysi, a people who had migrated there from Thrace, probably late in the second millennium BCE. Sources vary on the extent and subdivisions of the region, but in general it seems to have been at least roughly bounded on the north by the Hellespont and Propontis, on the east by the Rhyndacus river (modern Mustafakemalpaşa) and mount Olympus (Ulu Dağ), and on the west either by the Aisepos river (Gönen Çayı) or (if the Troad is taken to be part of Mysia) the Aegean Sea.",
