  "description": "The Via Vitularia was a Roman road that is now unlocated but originally was to be found in the territory of Arpinum. Cicero mentions it in his correspondence. It likely led from Arpinum in the Italian interior to the Tyrrhenian coast. Its name is derived from the first-declension Latin noun vitula, -ae meaning \"heifer\", thus the road's name may reflect its function, similar to the case of the Via Salaria, as Hodges points out in his commentary on Cicero's letters.",
