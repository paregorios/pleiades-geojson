  "description": "Razliq is a village situated ca. 13 km north of the city Sarāb in Eastern Azerbaijan (Iran). Here a rock inscription of the Urartian king Argišti II, son of Rusa (end of 8th / first half of 7th century BCE), has been found which reports military campaigns of Argišti II to this region. As well as the rock inscription of Nashteban (CTU A 11-5) it is situated on the southern slope of the Sabalān Mountains at an altitude of 4810 m. Although the inscription reports the building of a fortress named ‘stronghold of Argišti’ no such archaeological remains have been discovered so far. Together with the rock inscriptions found in Nashteban (CTU A 11-5) and Shisheh (CTU A 11-6) the rock inscription found near Razliq is one of the Urartian inscriptions found furthest to the east.",
