  "description": "According to Polybius, this ancient settlement of Aetolia was razed by Philip of Macedon. Stephanus of Byzantium places Metapa in Acarnania. Pritchett (SAGT) meticulously describes the vicinity and identifies the site of Metapa based on ancient stone blocks in conditions of reuse and abandonment, as well as plentiful ceramic sherds in the vicinity of an older and modern church of the Analipsis on the lake shore just east of the modern village of Daphnias.",
