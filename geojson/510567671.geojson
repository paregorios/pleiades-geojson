  "description": "Roman villa at modern Benalm√°dena Costa on the Spanish Mediterranean coast, southwest of Malaga. The site is located on the north corner of the intersection of Avenida Antonio Machado and Avenida de las Palmeras. Most of the excavated portions of this large villa, which included a garden and water feature, are conserved or reburied under modern structures; however, a walled pit makes some portion of the extant remains visible to passerby.",
