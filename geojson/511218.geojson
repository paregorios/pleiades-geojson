  "description": "An ancient city of Mysia in Anatolia, perhaps founded by the Corinthians in 756 BC and then again by the Milesians ca. 675 BC. Its advantageous position in the Propontis made it a major commercial centre. In the 5th century BC it was part of the Delian League and in the Hellenistic Age it was close to the Attalid kings. In the Imperial period, it became an assize centre (conventus) of the province of Asia.",
