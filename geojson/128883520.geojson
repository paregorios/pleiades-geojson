  "description": "The small town of Burmarina belonged to the area of the city Til-Barsip which was under Neo-Assyrian rule. An archive, consisting of about 130 clay tablets and fragments, including some bullae, was discovered in two rooms, presumably part of a private house, in Area F. Although most texts were written in Assyrian, some were in Aramaic, and some had short Aramaic notes written in ink. While most of the Assyrian texts were loan or purchase documents, the archive also includes short notes and a list. The Aramaic texts concern loans or are short notes written on bullae.",
