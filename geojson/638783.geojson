  "description": "A Roman castellum, located adjacent to the ancient settlement of Aporidos Come and the Aulutrene lake (modern Çapalı/Karakuyu in Turkey's Afyonkarahisar province). An initial (temporary?) camp on/near the location may have been established as early as the second century BC; however, archaeological and epigraphic evidence point to a small, stone-built installation with associated garrison, possibly during the Severan period that was later expanded in Byzantine times. The stone structure, at the modern town of Eldere, was heavily quarried and built over by the 1980s.",
