  "description": "Tell Agrab, or Ajrab, is a medium-sized archaeological mound in the Diyala Province of central Iraq, some forty kilometers east of Baghdad. The site was excavated by archaeologists from the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago in 1936 and 1937. Tell Agrab seems to have been inhabited from the early 3rd millennium BCE until the beginning of the Old Babylonian Period (ca. 1800 BCE). In its early history, the site held a temple possibly dedicated to the god Å ara.",
