  "description": "A shaft well nearly forty metres deep on the north side of the Acropolis of Athens, opened up around 1200 BC to provide a water supply for the citadel. It was abandoned after the upper staircase collapsed around 1175 BC and filled with rubbish. The entrance is near the northwest corner of the house of the Arrhephoroi.",
