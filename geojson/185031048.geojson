  "description": "The Temple of Athena in Miletos dates originally to the sixth century BCE, although the visible remains on site today belong to the Classical rebuilding of MIletos (ca. 479-450 BCE). The temple had a peripteral plan and was executed in the Ionic order. Unusually, its axis is oriented north-south.",
