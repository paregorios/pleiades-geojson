  "description": "In a house in dA9III, next to the outer surface of the ruined inner town wall, excavators discovered a room with a sarcophagus, two graves and a grave with sherds. In this room, they found an archive of about 38 clay tablets above the sarcophagus, one clay tablet in the grave with sherds and 3 fragmentary tablets in another sarcophagus just outside the ruined town wall. Whether the last group belongs to the same house is unclear. The archive, dating from 698 to the final years of the Assyrian Empire, probably belonged to a man called Nabu-šuma-iddina, although other men are attested as well. Texts include purchase documents concerning houses, slaves and fields, loan documents and juridical settlements, as well as some other types of documents, as well as a fragmentary tablet with the second half of a bilingual literary composition called Examination Text A.",
