  "description": "An ancient, fortified oasis settlement in the western Arabian peninsula that has produced archaeological evidence for occupation from prehistoric times to today. It is named \"Hibra\" in an inscription of Nabonidus, dating to the 6th century BCE, and features as the site of a Mohammedan conquest in the early years of Islam. Recent discoveries nearby of large \"desert kites\" (putative animal capture structures), neolithic campsites, and megalithic tombs have received significant press and highlight the site's importance at an early date.",
