  "description": "An island located in the East Lagoon of modern Marsa Matruh, Libya (ancient Paraetonium). Excavations on the island revealed evidence for a small shelter and/or revictualing station for ships' crews engaged in coastal trade during the late Bronze Age: a modest walled shelter as well as Minoan, Mycenaean, Cypriot, Canaanite, and Egyptian pottery. There is some minor archaeological evidence for subsequent periods, especially from the 8th century onward, but these are insufficient to gauge what sort of use(s) the island may have been put to during the pre-Roman and Roman periods (when Paraetonium occupied the entire southern shoreline of the lagoon.",
