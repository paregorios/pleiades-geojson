  "description": "In House 9, in a room to the back of the main room of the house (in dA6IV), excavators found an archive of 14 clay tablets, three of them written in Aramaic. The house is situated next to another house containing an archive (Assur Archive 33). The available datings range from 675 BC to the years shortly before the fall of the city of Assur. All legible texts, belonging to an individual named Kakkullanu and others, are concerned with silver. Among these documents are loan documents and two texts, one of them in Aramaic, that list quantities of silver in connection with various persons, probably for internal administration.",
