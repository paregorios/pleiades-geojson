  "description": "The collective tomb known in modern times as \"La Cachette de Bab el-Gasous\" at Deir el-Bahari in Egypt was discovered in the early twentieth century and its contents (the remains and funerary equipment of 153 members of the Theban elite dating to the end of the 21st dynasty) were distributed to some 90 museums around the world. The tomb extended under the \"Court of Hatshepsut\" from a concealed entry located north of the east end of the court and now surrounded by a low stone wall.",
