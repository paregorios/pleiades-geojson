  "description": "A temple sacred to Sol (\"The Sun\") and Luna (\"The Moon\") that likely predated the imperial construction of the Circus Maximus. Given this dating, the preexisting temple came to be incorporated into the cavea of the circus. The temple is iconographically represented in coin issues of the reign of Trajan.",
