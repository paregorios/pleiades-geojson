  "description": "In the northeastern corner of Dur-Katlimmu stood a large building complex (Building F and W). While it has been described as a \"palace\", it was not a royal palace, as no royal inscriptions were found there. In Room B of Building F, an archive was discovered. It consists of 19 Aramaic dockets, previously attached to perishable material, one Aramaic tablet, five Neo-Assyrian tablets and an envelope, as well as a Neo-Babylonian letter in its envelope. More texts were found in nearby rooms, including another Neo-Babylonian tablet. The texts date between 676 BC and the end period of the empire.",
