  "description": "A sanctuary in the Taygetos mountains, attested in both literary and epigraphic texts, its precise location cannot yet be determined; however scattered and reused architectural components and inscriptions have been found in the area of the Chapel of Panagia Kapsocherovolousa, Volimos, northwest of modern Alagonia in the Peloponnese. Of uncertain foundation date, but confirmed by the Roman Senate under Tiberius as belonging to the Messenians (as part of the Ager Denthaliatis), rather than the Spartans.",
