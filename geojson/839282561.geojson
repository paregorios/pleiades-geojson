  "description": "A villa on Lake Como described by Pliny the Younger. Scholars have long thought it must be located in the vicinity of modern Lierna, and 19th and 20th century finds of floor mosaics and other elements have led to conjectures that the villa must have been located either in the peninsular \"Castello\" neighborhood or in the core of the old town, which has long been known as \"Villa\" because of this conjecture. A mosaic from the latter area is now conserved in the Archaeological Museum of Lecco.",
