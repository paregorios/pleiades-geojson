  "description": "In the ninth century BC, Ashurnasirpal II (r. 883-859 BC) built himself a new administrative center. Kalhu (biblical Calah) — modern Nimrud, a site identified as Larissa, a city mentioned in Xenophon’s Anabasis — became the capital of the Assyrian Empire, replacing Ashur, which had served as Assyria’s capital since the third millennium BC. The city — which is located twenty miles south of the modern Mosul and which occupied a strategic position six miles north of the point where the Tigris River meets the Greater/Upper Zab — served as Assyria’s capital until the reign of Sargon II (r. 721–705 BC). Although Kalhu never again became the primary residence of Assyria’s kings, that city remained a vital administrative, military, and religious center until the fall of the Assyrian Empire.",
