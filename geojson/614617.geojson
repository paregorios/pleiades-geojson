  "description": "Attapinis is included as an unlocated place on Map 62 of the Barrington Atlas. The word \"Attapinis\" is attested in a fragmentary inscription found in Armenia as part of a fragmentary, signed funereal relief. ᾿Αλέξανδρος ᾿Αττάπινις is identified as a Phrygian stonemason by Loewy. Buckler et al. (1925) offer an interpretation that seems to be at odds with the compilers of the Barrington Atlas and with the contributors to the Treccani Encyclopedia, as well as with E. Loewy and the RE compilers. Buckler et al. reject the notion of \"Attapinis\" as a toponym and instead suggest that it ought to be read as a Phrygian approximate of ᾿Αλέξανδρος.",
