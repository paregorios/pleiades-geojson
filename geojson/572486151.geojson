  "description": "Mound site in the Amuq Plain inhabited from the late 4th millennium BCE-mid-1st millennium BCE. In the Late Bronze Age Chatal Höyük was the site of a sizeable town with connections to the Hittite Empire. In the Iron Age the town was within the sphere of the Syro-Hittite state of Unqi, based at Tell Tayinat/Kinaliya. The town gradually declined, but remained inhabited without interruption until at least the fifth century BCE.",
