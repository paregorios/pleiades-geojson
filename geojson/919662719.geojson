  "description": "In a private house in fD8I, excavators discovered an archive of 45 clay tablets and 37 fragments of clay tablets, some of which have since been joined together. Two more clay tablets were located nearby in the same level. The tablets date to the 7th century. The archive, belonging to Nabu-zera-iddina and other goldsmiths, consists of letters, loans, purchase documents, lists of personal names, textiles and amounts of silver, as well as notes and four ‘Median’ texts, among others.",
