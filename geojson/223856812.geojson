  "description": "Gleieh (also Gleiʾeh, Glaiʿā) is small site in the middle Euphrates region and was part of the kingdom of Suhu. The city, which is probably to be identified with ancient Kār-Apladad, was situated on the south bank of the Euphrates, opposite Sur Jureh (which lies on the northern bank). Like many towns and cities of the ancient kingdom of Suhu, Gleieh/Kār-Apladad is now underwater; the area was flooded after the construction of the Haditha dam.",
