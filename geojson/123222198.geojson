  "description": "A tomb of the late second century BCE originally located near the Via Ostensis in the district of Rome now known as Testaccio. In antiquity, this was the area known as the Emporium. The tomb is visible on a fragment of the Severan marble plan of Rome and it lies between the Horrea Galbana and the “Porticus Aemilia”. It was rediscovered in 1885 and reconstructed on the grounds of the municipal antiquarium on the Caelian Hill. The tomb belongs to a Servius Sulpicius Galba and is likely to be that of either the consul of 144 BCE or the consul of 108 BCE.",
