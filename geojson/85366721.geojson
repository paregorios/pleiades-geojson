  "description": "Davti-blur is the Armenian name of an Urartian settlement situated on a natural hill near the modern village Nor-Armavir. Just like the settlement on the immediately adjacent hill Armavir which in Urartian was called Argištihinili (\"city of Argišti\") it was founded by Argišti I, son of Minua (8th century BCE). In Davti-Blur, a column base with an inscription of Argišti I was found which reports the construction of a building. Furthermore, several inscriptions on clay pithoi by Argišti have been found there which attest to the administrative activity at this place. A stone block of the Urartian king Sarduri II, son of Argišti I (8th century BCE) reveals that the place was further developed and extended by Sarduri II.",
