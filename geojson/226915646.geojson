  "description": "Most documents found in the Northwest Palace, built by the Assyrian king Ashurnarsipal II (883–859 BC), predate the move of the new Assyrian capital to Dur-Šarrukin under Sargon II (721–705 BC). The archive found in Rooms ZT 13–17 was written between 687 BC and 614 BC, thus postdating this move. This repository contained about sixty clay tablets, specifically loan documents, the sale of slaves and land, juridical texts, marriage contracts, and administrative lists.",
