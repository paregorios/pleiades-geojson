  "description": "Most documents found in the Northwest Palace, built by the Assyrian king Ashurnarsipal II (883–859 BC), predate the move of the new Assyrian capital to Dur-Šarrukin under Sargon II (721–705 BC). An archive repository of 180 clay tablets were found in Room 57. These texts, which date from 800 to 736 BC, are mostly sale documents; there is also a list of oxen. The older documents in the archive generally deal with the purchase of slaves and houses, whereas the younger documents record the purchase of fields, some by servants of the queen.",
