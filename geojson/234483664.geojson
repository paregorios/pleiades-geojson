  "description": "An ancient, now-vanished, branch of the Nile River. Geophysical research has demonstrated that the Ahramat Branch, no longer visible to the naked eye, was located west of the main Nile River channel and flowed from south of Lisht to the area of the Giza Plateau area. This channel would have bordered on the complexes of more than 30 ancient pyramids ranging in date from the Old Kingdom to Second Intermediate Period (2686âˆ’1649 BCE).",
