  "description": "From the late Early Dynastic period (ED III, ca. 2500/2400 BC) until 614 BC, there was a temple in the city of Assur dedicated to Ištar, a goddess who was revered in that important northern-Mesopotamian city in a few different forms. Several building phases (designated “Temples H–A,” from earliest to latest) were excavated by W. Andrae between 1905 and 1914. Periodically the location and orientation of the Ištar temple changed, especially during the reigns of the Middle Assyrian kings Tukultī-Ninurta I (1243–1207 BC) and Aššur-rēša-iši I (1132–1115 BC). The earliest and latest textual records for the existence of the temple date respectively to the time of Ititi, a local ruler of Assur during the Old Akkadian Period, and the reign of Sîn-šarra-iškun (626–612 BC), the penultimate king of Assyria.",
