  "description": "Diqdiqah is a small satellite of the ancient city of Ur in the present-day Dhi Qar province of southern Iraq ca. 20 kilometres southwest of Nasiriyah. The site has yielded substantial archaeological remains dating to the late third and early second millennium BC, including the remains of a large structure called 'The Treasury of SÃ®n-iddinam'. Diqdiqah saw brief excavations by British archaeologists Leonard Woolley and Max Mallowan in 1924.",
