  "description": "An ancient settlement of Macedonia, probably to be located south of the modern village of Aravisos at the site of a now-abandoned small town known in the 19th century as Palaiokastro. Some scholars have also proposed its equation with an attested mutatio Scurio on the Via Egnatia, but the latter, despite a probable relationship with Kyrros, is more likely to be found further south.",
