  "description": "This \"Mesopotamian-style temple\" site located near modern Dishu in Afghanistan's Helmand province was excavated in the 1970s. Carbon-14 dates and \"Greek-style architectural fragments and fine red pottery\" led the excavators to date the use of the site from the late Hellenistic and Parthian period to \"the beginning of the Sasanian period in the 3rd century\" CE. Finds included a fragmentary bilingual (Greek/Aramaic) inscription possibly mentioning a Parthian king Phraates and the Iranian deity Ahuramazda.",
