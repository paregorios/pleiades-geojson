  "description": "An architectural complex located on the West side of the East Church in Apollonia (Cyrenaica). Excavated in 1954-55, it was first thought to be a temple of Isis (Stucchi 1975). According to Kenrick (2013), it is more likely to have been a small production centre, maybe for the fermentation of wine.",
