  "description": "Although the Classical/Hellenistic city was deserted in Pausanias' day, archaeology reveals that the area of modern Nafplio and its natural harbor on the Argolic Gulf was repeatedly a site of habitation and human activity from the Neolithic period to the modern day. Remains of a Hellenistic acropolis wall have been identified under the later Byzantine (with subsequent accretions and modifications) fort.",
