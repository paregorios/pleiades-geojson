  "description": "In the Palace of Ashurbanipal (North Palace), in the southwest corner nineteenth-century British excavators unearthed the remains of a library, including many clay tablets inscribed with literary texts. During the reign of Ashurbanipal (r. 668–ca. 631 BC), the last great king of Assyria, the tablets found in this archive repository were probably part of his tablet collection. Because these tablets were excavated very close to the Nabû temple (Ezida), which also had its own archival repository, some of the tablets thought to have come from the so-called “Library of Ashurbanipal” might have actually belonged to the neighboring Nabû temple. Today, the North Palace library material is not clearly differentiated from that of Ezida, due to the fact that the excavators did not provide detailed information about the exact findspots of the tablets.",
