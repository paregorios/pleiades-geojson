  "description": "The Stoa at Brauron, within the larger Artemis Brauronia complex, housed dining spaces as well as votive offerings to the goddess Artemis. The Stoa was Î -shaped, wrapping around a courtyard that separated it from the temple of Artemis at Brauron, which it faced. Worship at the cult site began ca. the eighth century BCE. The site was abandoned after a flood in the third century BCE.",
