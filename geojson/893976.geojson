  "description": "An imperial capital of the Arsacid and Sassanid empire, this large ancient city originated at least as early as the third century BCE and declined in the eighth century of the modern era. It was located on the left bank of the Tigris river 35km south of what would later become modern Baghdad in Iraq. It was part of a complex network of settlements in the area, among which Seleucia (modern Vēh Ardašīr) also featured prominently. It was attacked, and sometimes occupied, by Roman forces multiple times.",
