  "description": "From Hesiod onward, Greek writers locate the Nemean lion in a cave or ravine in this mountain and explain the mountain's name (\"perforated\") from being split by the ravine. Wiseman (in PECS, whence ToposText) identifies the Tretos as \"the mountain on the W side of the main road between Kleonaia-Corinthia and Argolis\" and the ravine as the modern Dervenakia pass. Camp in BAtlas silently suppresses this view, and mentioning \"Tretos\" only in a list of \"unlocated\" features in the map-by-map directory where he cites only Pausanias and glosses: \"Corinthia-Argolis: pass, road\".",
