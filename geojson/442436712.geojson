  "description": "A Roman vexillation fortress of the first century A.D. was located at Longthorpe near Peterborough. The site was first identified via crop marks in 1961 and some excavations were carried out between 1967 and 1971. Nothing of the site is now visible as it has been consumed by a golf course. The fort had two phases: the first phase of 11 ha (27 acres) dates as early as A.D. 44-48 (definitely occupied by 61-62. A contracted phase of 4.5 ha (11 acres) followed later.",
