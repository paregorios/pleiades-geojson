  "description": "In a private house in cD9II, excavators found the remains of a small library of 25 fragmentary clay tablets with a few other tablets nearby. Most of these are literary texts and date to the Sargonid period. The library consists of epics, an omen series, a commentary on an omen series, either a commentary or a vocabulary, and a list of persons. Possibly, the library also includes a king list and a text listing the duties of priests of the Aššur temple.",
