  "description": "In House C1 in the Lower City of Til-Barsip, 22 Assyrian clay tablets, as well as 2 Aramaic texts, were discovered in and around the doorway between Room XI and XII in a secondary position. The earliest text dates to 683 BC, during the reign of Sennacherib (704-681 BC), but most of the documents date later, to the reign of Ashurbanipal (668-ca. 631 BC). The archive belonged to a man called Hanni, with some of the texts also concerning a man named Ištar-duri, and consists of purchase and loan documents as well as some others, such as a juridicial agreement.",
