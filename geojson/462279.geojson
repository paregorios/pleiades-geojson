  "description": "A Greek colonial city founded by Naxians in 729 B.C., Leontini was reduced by Hippocrates of Gela in 498 B.C. Following the Sicilian Expedition, the city became subject to Syracuse. In Roman times it may have been of little importance and was destroyed by the Saracens in A.D. 848.",
