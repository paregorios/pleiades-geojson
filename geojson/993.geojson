  "description": "An ancient region covering a large part of southwestern Europe, roughly approximating the territory of modern France. It was bounded by the Atlantic ocean, the Pyrenees mountains, the Mediterranean, the Alps, and the river Rhine. Gallia was famously described by Caesar as the territory of the ancient Celts (Celtae), whom the Romans called Gauls (Galli in Latin), hence the common modern usage \"Gaul\" for the region.",
