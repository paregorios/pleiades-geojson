  "description": "\"Aedes Summanus\" or \"Templum Summanus\" was a temple built near the Circus Maximus during the war with Pyrrhus. It could have been located on the slope of the Aventine Hill. The temple was likely built after the terracotta statue of Summanus included in the pedimental sculpture of the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill, causing the statue's head to be flung into the river Tiber.",
