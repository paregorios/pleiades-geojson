  "description": "An ancient dam, subsequently reused, repaired, and adapted into modern times, in the Glosses pass east of Alyzeia (modern Kalima) and just below the later site of the Byzantine fortress of Varnako/Barnako. Remains of aqueduct and mill fittings of various dates have been noted; the dam and its reservoir are presumed to have been created originally (perhaps in Classical or Hellenistic times) to supply some portion of Alyzeia or its chora.",
