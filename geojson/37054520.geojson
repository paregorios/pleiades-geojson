  "description": "A Mycenaean palace located on the Acropolis of Athens was probably built in the Late Helladic IIIB period (13th century BC). Its existence is inferred from various earthworks and a limestone column base, which suggest that it was located in the area of the Erechtheion. It probably ceased to function in the Late Helladic IIIC period (12th-11th centuries BC).",
