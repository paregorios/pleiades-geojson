  "description": "A settlement mound immediately south of modern Stroviki (municipality of Orchomenos, Thessaly and Central Greece) has yielded archaeological evidence for activity from the Neolithic to the Classical period, with a significant floruit during the Helladic period when the site bordered the northern edge of Lake Copais. Evidence of Mycenean-era hydraulic works involved in the partial draining and control of the lake have been identified in the vicinity.",
