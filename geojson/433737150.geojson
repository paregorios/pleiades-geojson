  "description": "Construction of a church dedicated to the Twelve Apostles at Constantinople began in 330 CE under Constantine the Great, and was completed during the reign of his son Constantius II (331-367). A larger church was established on the same site in 550 by Justinian I. The church was demolished by Mehmed II in 1462, and the Fatih Mosque was constructed on its site.",
