  "description": "Ada / Adalar is a village in Southeast Anatolia. It is located a few kilometres southwest of Malazgirt in the Turkish province Muş. Nearby is a rock inscription of the Urartian King Minua (ca. 810-785/80 BCE), in which he reports the construction of a Canal named \"Canal of Minua\", which is still in use today. In Late Antiquity, the canal was attributed to the legendary Queen Semiramis by the Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi (ca. 410–490s).",
