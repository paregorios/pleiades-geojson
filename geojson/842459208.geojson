  "description": "An unfinished Doric stoa with colonnades on both long sides, built at Thorikos in the late fifth century BC, of uncertain function, perhaps a gateway to a sanctuary of Demeter. Material from the structure was spoliated in the Augustan period to build the southwest temple in the Athenian Agora.",
