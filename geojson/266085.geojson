  "description": "A Roman-period hilltop site, partially excavated in the 20th century, that lies just west of the modern Spanish village of El Chuche in the municipal district of Benahadux, Almeria. It is probably to be associated with the attested Roman name \"Urci\". The archaeological record of human habitation on and near the site stretches back to the Chalcolithic.",
