  "description": "The temple-tower of the god Ninurta, which was started by the ninth-century-BC Assyrian ruler Ashurnasirpal II (r. 883–859 BC) and completed by his son and successor Shalmaneser III (r. 858–824 BC), is still the most prominent feature of Kalhu (modern Nimrud). This multi-staged ziggurat, whose remains are now a pyramid of eroding mud-brick, was constructed in the northwest corner of the citadel, next to Kalhu's principal sanctuary, the Ninurta temple.",
