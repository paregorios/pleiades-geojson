  "description": "The Ain Dara temple, an archaeological site located near the village of Ain Dara, in Afrin, Syria, was the location of an Iron Age Syro-Hittite temple. The structure was noted for the similarities it bore to Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem. The site was in use from ca. 1300 until 740 BCE. It finds comparison with the temples at Emar, Mumbaqa, and Ebla's Temple D. In January 2018 the ruins of the temple were substantially damaged by air strikes carried out by the Turkish Air Force during the Afrin offensive. The site also subsequently suffered further damage, wanton destruction, and looting.",
