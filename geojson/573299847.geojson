  "description": "The sanctuary of Artemis Brauronia on the Acropolis of Athens was a branch of the sanctuary of Artemis at Brauron in eastern Attica, perhaps established by Peisistratos or his sons in the second half of the sixth century BC, although the surviving structure probably dates from the 430s BC. It consisted of a Doric stoa with two wings surrounding a court, hosted a giant bronze statue of the Trojan horse by Strongylion, and was probably the site of the Arkteia ritual.",
