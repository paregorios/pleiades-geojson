  "description": "The Square Peristyle is the modern name for a large square peristyle in the northeast corner of the Agora of Athens, begun around 300 BC, but never completed. It may have functioned as a lawcourt in the early Hellenistic period. It was demolished and used to build South Stoa II in the early 2nd century BC. The site was subsequently used for the Stoa of Attalos",
