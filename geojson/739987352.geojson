  "description": "A statue included in the Regionary Catalogue for Regio XIV, the Statua Valeriana evidently honored some members of the gens Valeria. It is possible that this statue in the Transtiberim replaced a bronze equestrian statue that depicted Cloelia or perhaps Valeria, the daughter of Valerius Popolicola, that had stood in summa Sacra Via until it was destroyed by fire prior to the time of Dionysius of Halicarnassus. Based on a Trajanic inscription (CIL 6, 975), the statue lent its name to a vicus.",
