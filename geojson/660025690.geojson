  "description": "A marble monument surrounded by a peribolos on the west side of the Athenian Agora, built ca. 350 BC, which supported bronze statues of the namesakes of the Athenian tribes (phylai): Erechtheus, Aigeus, Pandion, Leos, Akamas, Oineus, Kekrops, Hippothoon, Aias/Ajax, and Antiochos. Antigonos Monophthalmos and Demetrios Poliorketes were added in 308/7 BC and removed in 201/0 BC. Ptolemy III was added in 224/3 BC, Attalos I in 201/0 BC, and Hadrian around A.D. 125. The monument was used as the official noticeboard of the Athenian democracy.",
