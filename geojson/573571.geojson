  "description": "Now unlocated, Tripodiskos was a market center of Megara. According to Pausanias, its name is connected to the activities of Coroebus who was ordered by the Pythia of Delphi to carry the Delphic tripod and to establish a new shrine to the god at the place where it fell from his hands. This was Tripodiskos; Pausanias indicates that Coroebus' tomb was located in its agora.",
