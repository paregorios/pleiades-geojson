  "description": "Bahçecik is a Turkish village situated in the Elazığ Province in eastern Anatolia. In the north of the village, the ruins of an Urartean fortress and a stone inscription of the Urartean ruler Sarduri, son of Arğišti, (8th century BCE) have been found. The inscription (CTU A 9-18) reports that Sarduri built the fortress and gave it the name \"Sardurihinili\" (\"the Sardurian (fortress)\"). The text further reports the construction of a tower temple (\"susi temple\") by the same ruler and the installation of a governor to oversee the western regions that Sarduri conquered during his campaigns.",
