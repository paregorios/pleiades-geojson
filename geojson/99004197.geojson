  "description": "Located just east of modern Sarantaporo in the Elassona municipality (Larisa, Greece), this ancient settlement was excavated in the late 20th century. Its excavators proposed an identification with ancient Doliche, which previously had been only provisionally located. It may represent the original seat of Doliche. The late-antique fortified site at Kastri Livadiou (q.v.) seems to have made use of spoliated material including an inscription that names Doliche as a polis.",
