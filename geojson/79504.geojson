  "description": "Modern Hayling Island (borough of Havant, Hampshire, England) is the site of a multi-phase sanctuary: the Iron Age shrine dates ca. 50 BCE and the Roman temple dates ca. 55-60CE. The sanctuary seems to have suffered decline and ceased being maintained in the early third century CE, although ritual/votive deposition seems to have continued through the fourth century.",
