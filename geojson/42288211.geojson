  "description": "The Temple of Athena Pallenis was built in the mid-6th century BC and rebuilt on a larger scale in the late 5th century BC. In myth, the location was the site of King Eurystheus' tomb and Theseus' victory over the Pallantidai. In 546 BC, it was the site of the battle by which Peisistratos finally established his tyranny. At the end of the 1st century BC, the structure was disassembled and rebuilt in the Agora of Athens as the Temple of Ares.",
