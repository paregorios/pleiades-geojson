  "description": "At the eastern corner of the large ziggurat in Assur, a group of clay tablets were unearthed in a house in area hB4V. Forty clay tablets were found above a sarcophagus, 25 clay tablets were also located nearby and either some or all of them could belong to the first group. Additionally, a clay pot, containing 13 tablets, was found in a door opening of a different house. The texts seem to form a library, except for the tablets in the pot, which formed a separate archive (Assur Archive 51). The library, dating primarily to the 7th century BCE, belonged to a family of scribes and mainly contained documents pertaining to that profession: lexical lists, astronomical and astrological texts, omens, incantations, other literary texts, and drafts or copies of royal inscriptions.",
