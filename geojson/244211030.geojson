  "description": "A three-aisled basilical church, with an external apse, situated near the centre of the ancient settlement of Apollonia (Cyrenaica), about half way between the East and West churches. The building has a narthex, a small western atrium and a range of added rooms along the north flank. The mosaics have been dated around the sixth century AD, but the building seems to have been built in earlier times (possibly fifth century AD).",
