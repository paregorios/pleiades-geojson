  "description": "Most documents found in the Northwest Palace, built by the Assyrian king Ashurnarsipal II (883–859 BC), predate the move of the new Assyrian capital to Dur-Šarrukin under Sargon II (721–705 BC). A few tablets were found in Rooms ZT 30 and ZT 31, on the eastern side of the northernmost courtyard of the palace. The administrative texts found in this archive repository include lists of quantities of oil (delivered to the palace), which were presumably stored in the large jars that were also found inside both rooms.",
