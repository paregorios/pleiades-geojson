  "description": "The modern Greek village of Dimini in Thessaly lends its name to important prehistoric and Bronze Age settlements whose remains lie in its vicinity. In the 20th century, some scholars attempted to assign the placename \"Aison\" (reported by Stephanus of Byzantium) here as well, but others now reject the name entirely as false. The vicinity was abandoned at the end of the thirteenth century BCE and not reoccupied until modern times.",
