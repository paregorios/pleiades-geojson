  "description": "An ancient settlement in the upper watershed of the Skamander (modern Karamenderes) river, located at and around the modern village of Kurşunlu in Turkey's Bayramiç (Çanakkale province). Significant archaeological remains, including a probable temple, on the dome-shaped hill immediately west of the modern village were reported in the 19th century, but these are no longer evident, the site having been quarried for construction in the village and in Bayramiç. Rescue excavations between the hill and the river revealed Roman and Byzantine-era structures, including a bath complex, in the late 20th century, prior to the filling of the reservoir created by the Bayramiç dam.",
