  "description": "Marad (modern Tell Wannat es-Sadum), a city located ca. 60 km southeast of Babylon, was the cult center of the god Lugal-Marda; it is approximately halfway between Babylon and Isin, on the Arahtu canal. Details about the cultic topography of this settlement, which was established in the Early Dynastic Period (ca. 2700 BC), are known from a number of cuneiform sources, including Neo-Babylonian royal inscriptions, the so-called \"Canonical Temple List,\" and two first-millennium-BC ziggurat lists. Marad's principal temple, Eigikalama, is attested from the Old Akkadian Period to Neo-Babylonian Period.",
