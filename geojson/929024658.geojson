  "description": "A temple built on the Acropolis of Athens ca. 575 BC, known from architectural and sculptural fragments, which include a three-headed snake-man whose beards are blue. One possibility is that it stood on the DÃ¶rpfeld foundations, serving as an early temple of Athena Polias, and was succeeded by the Archaios Neos at the end of the 6th century BC. The other is that it was an early temple of Athena Parthenos, located on the site of the Parthenon, and succeeded by the Older Parthenon in the 480s BC.",
