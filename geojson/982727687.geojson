  "description": "A house at the southwestern corner of the Athenian Agora, built ca. 500 BC, destroyed during the Persian Sack in 480 BC, rebuilt in the 470s and demolished in the late fourth century BC. Finds suggest that in the third quarter of the fifth century BC it belonged to a shoemaker named Simon, perhaps to be identified with the interlocutor of Sokrates known from literary sources.",
