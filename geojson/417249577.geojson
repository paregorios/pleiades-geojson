  "description": "A West Semitic semi-nomadic group attested principally in Babylonia during the first millennium BCE. The Sutû are also attested in cuneiform sources of the second millennium BCE, including several of the Amarna Letters, and these earlier texts provide evidence for the Suteans living in the Levant and Syria, west of the Euphrates River.",
