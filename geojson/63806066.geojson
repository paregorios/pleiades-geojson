  "description": "Agade was the capital of the Akkadian state, which was the dominant military and political force in southern Mesopotamia ca. 2334-2113 B.C. Agade (also known as Akkad and Akkade) is mentioned in cuneiform texts from the late third millennium B.C. to the Neo-Babylonian period. The exact location is still unknown and debated among scholars, many of whom place it along or east of the Tigris River, between Samarra and Baghdad.",
