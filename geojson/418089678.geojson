  "description": "In a private house in Assur, cut into by the excavation trench 6III, researchers found the remains of a library and an archive, consisting of at least 136 tablets and possibly 52 more tablets. The texts date from the 8th and 7th centuries BCE. The two or three best-attested individuals in Assur Archive 19 held the title nargallu, \"chief singer\" or \"musician\". The library contained many hymns and similar texts, but also other literary texts such as myths, hemerological texts, royal inscriptions, and various lexical lists. The archive, mixed with the library, includes loan and purchase documents, as well as other texts.",
