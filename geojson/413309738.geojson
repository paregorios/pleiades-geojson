  "description": "Sur Jureh (also Sur Jurʿeh, Sūr Ğurʿa) is a site in the middle Euphrates region in what was part of the ancient kingdom of Suhu. The city, which is probably to be identified with ancient Gabbāri-bānî (or Gabbāri-ibni), was situated on the north bank of the Euphrates, opposite Gleieh (which lies on the southern bank). Like many towns and cities of the ancient kingdom of Suhu, Sur Jureh/Gabbāri-bānî is now underwater; the area was flooded after the construction of the Haditha dam.",
