  "description": "A large, prehistoric site in modern Morocco's Kh√©misset province that, at the time of systematic excavations published in 2024, constitutes the \"earliest and largest agricultural complex in Africa beyond the Nile corridor\". The site (which lies on a long ridge of high ground) gets its name from the Baht River, which runs along the eastern edge and separates the site from the neighboring modern town, which also carries the same name.",
