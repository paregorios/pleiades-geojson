  "description": "Başbulak/Bulakbaşı/Kanî Kewang is situated near Taşburun in the Kars province in eastern Turkey. Here a stone block with an inscription of the Urartian king Minua (9th / 8th century BCE) was found, in which he claims to have built the building to which the stone block belonged. Furthermore, Minua states that he has built a fortress at this place and given it the name \"Minuahinili\". In Roman times, the locality was known as Paracata.",
