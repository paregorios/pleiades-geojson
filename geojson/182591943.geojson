  "description": "The popular toponym associated with this monument - Arco di Druso or Arch of Drusus - is a misnomer and is misleading. This is problematic given other textual, epigraphic, and archaeological attestations that mention honorific monuments dedicated to Nero Claudius Drusus. This place is the site of the remains of a triple-bay arch that is now reduced to the central bay. The monument sits astride the Via Appia just inside the Porta S. Sebastiano and has been referred to as \"Arco di Druso\" since the sixteenth century. The monument is built of travertine and faced with marble. This arch, in fact, supported the Aqua Antoniniana, a branch of the Aqua Marcia. The connection with Drusus is erroneous.",
