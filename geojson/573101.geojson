  "description": "A long-lived coastal settlement of the Peloponnese, mentioned by Pausanias and other authors. Its precise location has not been determined; however, it must have been relatively close to Boi(a)i, since it was one of the constituent poleis from which the latter was synoecized. The ToposText editors tentatively propose its localization at a now-vanished fortification north of Megali Spilia (and thus northwest of Neapolis).",
