  "description": "Two tiers of niches (similar to Dur-Šarrukin 1) were found in Room H 15 (on the northwestern side of Courtyard II) of the Nabû temple at Dur-Šarrukin, the short-lived capital of the Assyrian king Sargon II (721–705 BC). Although no inscribed objects were found inside the niches, the existence of a temple library is suggested by a similar construction in Room H 5 (on the northwestern side of Forecourt I). The empty niches might be the result of the move of the capital to Nineveh under Sennacherib (704–681 BC) or of the use of perishable writing materials.",
