  "description": "The famous gold flash of lightning of Adad was found in the northern room of a small house in Assur (in eB5V), built into the recess of the southwest wall of the Anu-Adad temple. In the same room, 7 coiled lead strips with hieroglyphic Luwian texts, dating to Neo-Assyrian times, together with an Old Assyrian inscription on an alabaster slab were found. This archive, probably belonging to a man called Takasla, consists of 6 letters which are mostly concerned with the sending of different objects.",
