  "description": "Pausanias describes this complex of two drainages near the Bay of Eleusis as sacred to Demeter and Persephone and as demarcating a territorial boundary between Athens and Eleusis. It was here that participants in the procession of the mystae were obliged to disembark from wagons and continue on foot to Eleusis. An inscribed decree of 422/421 BCE specifies the construction of pedestrian bridge for this purpose.",
