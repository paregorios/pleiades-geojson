  "description": "Sîn-šarra-iškun (626–612 BC), Assyria’s penultimate king, built a new temple for the god Nabû of the ḫarû at Assur. The temple was constructed in vacant lot that was next to the temple of the Assyrian Ištar. That Neo-Assyrian king modelled the temple’s plan on that the Nabû temple at Kalhu (Nimrud) and named it after the Nabû temple at Babylon. Egidrukalamasumu (“House Which Bestows the Scepter of the Land”) was destroyed in 614 BC, when Assur was destroyed by the Medes.",
