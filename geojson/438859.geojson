  "description": "\"Tutienses\" refers to an ancient tribe of Latium included in Pliny's geographical accounting of Roman Italy. In compiling this entry for the Barrington Atlas, N. Purcell has indicated that reference also be made to the toponym \"Tutia fl.\", a river discussed by Livy in the twenty-sixth book of his history. During the Second Punic War Hannibal realized that his chances of capturing the city of Rome herself were dwindling. At that point, Hannibal moved his camp back to the river Tutia, located 6 miles from the city (sex milia passuum ab urbe). Hannibal proceeded from that point to the grove of Feronia located at the foot of Mt. Soracte in South Etruria.",
