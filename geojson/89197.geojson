  "description": "An extensive Roman courtyard complex and associated crossroads settlement in East Yorkshire, lying to the immediate north of the modern Harpham Grange and northwest of Burton Agnes. A small portion of the mostly invisible site was excavated in the early 20th century, with a second (never published) excavation following in the 1950s. A 2019 geophysical survey and its publication (Maw 2021) have made the site more sensible and better documented.",
