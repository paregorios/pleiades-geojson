Its precise location is uncertain, but the mouth of the homonymous river (also recorded by Ptolemy) is widely agreed to be the modern Plymouth Sound; there are therefore several candidate sites for the city in the valley of the modern Tamar river, the most likely of which to date is the Roman fort at Calstock.",
