  "description": "Tel Hazor (Hebrew: תל חצור‎‎) is an archaeological site located in the southern Hula Valley overlooking Lake Merom. From the Middle Bronze Age to the Israelite period in the ninth century B.C., Hazor was the largest fortified city in the region. It served as a commercial center with links to Babylon and Syria. In the Book of Joshua, Hazor is described as “the head of all those kingdoms” (Josh. 11:10).",
