  "description": "South Stoa I is the modern name for the stoa that bounded the southern edge of the Agora of Athens from the late 5th century BC until the mid-2nd century BC, when it was demolished and replaced with South Stoa II. It contained rooms for communal dining and was probably the headquarters of the metronomoi and other officials.",
