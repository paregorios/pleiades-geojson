  "description": "A Gallo-Roman settlement that persisted until the fourth century of the modern era at modern La Chapelle-des-Fougeretz. Known since the 20th century, rescue excavations ahead of a housing development on the southwest edge of the modern town were conducted in 2022 and revealed a sanctuary of Mars, a civic bath complex, and a late-antique necropolis. The site's ancient name(s) are unknown.",
