  "description": "The archaeological area of Costia dei Lippi is located near the contemporary cemetery of Vetulonia. Excavations in this area began in the 1960s and revealed a series of stone walls built in a squared technique, as well as a system of terraces and a paved road. The area has been interpreted as a domestic quarter dating ca. the third to the first century BCE.",
