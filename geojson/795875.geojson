  "description": "Toutzis (Dendur) is located in Nubia, approximately 80 km south of modern Aswan. In 23 BCE the Roman provincial governor Petronius built a temple at the direction of Augustus. The temple was dedicated to Isis and the deified Nubian brothers Pedesi and Pihor. Imperiled by the Aswan High Dam project, the temple was relocated by UNESCO in 1963. Egypt gifted the temple to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, where it has been exhibited since 1978.",
