  "description": "Orraon was a city of the Molossians, founded probably in the early fourth century BCE and planned on a grid system. It may have been destroyed by the Romans after Pydna in 168 BCE, and its inhabitants were removed to Nikopolis in 31 BCE. The site is remarkable for the preservation of its stone-built domestic architecture.",
