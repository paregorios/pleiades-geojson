  "description": "The term \"Ager Cosanus\" refers to the territorium (territory) of the Latin right colony of Cosa, reportedly established by Rome in south Etruria in 273 B.C. following conflict with the Etruscan city of Vulci. The colonial center of Cosa has been the subject of ongoing archaeological inquiry since the late 1940s. Beginning in the 1970s, the hinterland of the city was subjected to intensive archaeological field survey. The Wesleyan University survey of the rural hinterland of Cosa identified approximately 132 sites.",
