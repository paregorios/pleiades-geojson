  "description": "Located on the east coast of the Messenian peninsula of the Peloponnese, the ancient city of Asine is thought to have stood where the modern settlement of Koroni stands now. Based on spolia and topography, its acropolis was probably on the spot now occupied by a Venetian castle (itself having supplanted an earlier Byzantine fortress).",
