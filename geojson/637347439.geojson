  "description": "A Pre-Roman Iron Age farmstead with a relatively short occupational history gave way to a Roman installation that was situated outside the confines of the first-century fort at Longthorpe near Peterborough. This installation was termed a \"works-depot\" by its excavators and shows evidence of both ceramic production and metalworking. The installation was likely established soon after the fort's own foundation in the late 40s. It is an unusual site for this period.",
