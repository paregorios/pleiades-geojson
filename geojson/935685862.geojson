  "description": "Approximately 85 clay tablets were discovered in the eastern room of a house adjoining the tarrace of the northeastern palace of Guzana. The texts were found in a secondary context, probably as fill, and belonged to Mannu-ki-Aššur, Assyrian governor in Guzana during the first quarter of the 8th century BC. The archive consists of letters to and from the governor, as well as administrative lists concerning persons, animals, and objects.",
