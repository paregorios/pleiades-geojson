  "description": "An ancient settlement, thought by modern scholars to have been located east of the site of ancient Olympia and south of the Alpheios river in the vicinity of modern Frixa. CFL/AGO reports the discovery of Classical/Hellenistic tombs just south of Frixa and west of Anemochoraki. The ToposText editors note the presence of pottery scatter just north of Phrixa village, coincident with the hilltop (Paliophanaro) identified in New Pauly as the site.",
