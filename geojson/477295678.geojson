  "description": "A temple of Tuscan type with cella and lateral alae built of ashlar masonry and dated to the 3rd century BCE, now built into a rural church and farmstead complex. The temple is situated along the Via Amerina between Ameria and Tuder, and marks the boundary between those two Umbrian communities. A fragmentary Umbrian bronze inscription (Vetter 229) of around 300 BCE mentioning a deity characterized as \"Iovia\" was discovered here in the 18th century CE.",
