  "description": "The Northwest Building on the Acropolis of Athens was built in the fifth century BC, probably in the 430s BC, north of the Propylaia. It may have been intended as a banqueting hall, but was never completed and remained an open-air courtyard, perhaps used for storage and staging purposes.",
