  "description": "In dD9IV, in the area of the ruined inner town wall where presumably private houses were located, excavators discovered a clay pot with around 12 clay tablets. Also in dD9IV, another clay pot with pieces of silver was found; a possible connection between these finds cannot be proven. The preserved datings are from the 7th century BCE. The archive, belonging to a man called Samidu with other men attested as well, appears to consist exclusively of purchase documents.",
