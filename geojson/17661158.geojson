  "description": "Located adjacent to the modern village of el-Samara (Dakahlia governorate, Egypt) and partly covered by its cemetery, this tell provides archaeological evidence for one of the earliest settlements identified in the Nile delta. Excavations have demonstrated that the settlement was founded in the 5th millennium BCE and subsequent habitation of the site continued to the beginning of the third millennium BCE.",
