  "description": "Massalia/Massilia (modern Marseille, France) was founded by Phocaean Greeks ca. 600 B.C. as a trading outpost. Massalia, in turn, established its own secondary colonies. During the Punic Wars Massalia was allied to Rome and, following the sacking of Carthage in 146 B.C., the settlement enjoyed increased economic vitality.",
