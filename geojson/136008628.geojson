  "description": "A rock-cut cistern on the southeast slope of the Pnyx hill in Athens, built in the late sixth century BC and supplied by the Peisistratid aqueduct. It received a mosaic floor in the second C AD. Dörpfeld identified it with the Enneakrounos fountain known from Classical literature, but this is disputed.",
